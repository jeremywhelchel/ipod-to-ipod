I wrote this back in 2006 for a project in college. It allowed one iPod running
iPod Linux to transfer music with another iPod to which it was directly
connected via a Firewire cable. This only worked with very early generation
iPods and this code certainly doesn't work anymore, but I figured I should
upload it in the off chance that it might be of interest to someone.
